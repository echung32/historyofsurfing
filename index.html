<h1>A history of surfing</h1>
<h2>What is Surfing?</h2>
<p>
    Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride
    on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore.
    Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
    ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
</p>
<p>
    The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types
    of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on
    alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
    modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also
    referred to as stand-up surfing.
